1. input type checkbox value

   A string representing the value of the checkbox. This is not displayed on the client-side, but on the server this is the value given to the data submitted with the checkbox's name. Take the following example:

   ```html
   <input
     type="checkbox"
     id="subscribeNews"
     name="subscribe"
     value="newsletter"
   />
   <label for="subscribeNews">Subscribe to newsletter?</label>
   ```

   In this example, we've got a name of subscribe, and a value of newsletter. When the form is submitted, the data name/value pair will be **subscribe=newsletter**.

   If the value attribute was **omitted**, the default value for the checkbox is on, so the submitted data in that case would be subscribe=on.

   Note: If a checkbox is **unchecked** when its form is submitted, there is no value submitted to the server to represent its unchecked state (e.g. value=unchecked); the value is not submitted to the server at all. If you wanted to submit a default value for the checkbox when it is unchecked, you could include an

   ```html
   <input type="hidden" />
   ```

   inside the form with the same name and value, generated by JavaScript perhaps.
